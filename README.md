ChildrenOfTheStars2D

The top player is player1, bottom is player2.

Player1 moves using WASD, the interaction key for player1 is E and L.
E is to "eat" the apple after player2 interats with the roots.
L is to spawn a light from the player (this doesn't do anything yet except for make a light visible).

P is used to swap between the players.

Player2 moves using the arrow keys, the interaction key is space.
When pressing space on the roots the roots will disappear and an apple will spawn.
